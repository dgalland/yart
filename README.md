# yart : Yet Another Raspberry Pi Telecine

First I have to thank Joe Herman for his project https://github.com/jphfilm/rpi-film-capture. My project is not a fork because all the software part has been rewritten. However, the concept and whole hardware part takes up Joe's ideas.

The app works for me and I captured several hours of movies. However the code is still experimental and requires some polishing.
